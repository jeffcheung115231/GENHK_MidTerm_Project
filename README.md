# JDE Mid-Term Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Genernation Hong Kong x Clap@JC JDE Mid-Term Project, which focuses on data analysis and scraping tools for market research and insights.

## Contents

The project includes the following components:

- Data Analysis Tools
- Brands (Wellcome, PARKnSHOP, Ztore)
- Scraping Tool
- Database
- Challenge
- Future Vision

## Data Analysis Tools

The Data Analysis Tools section covers the steps involved in market research and data analysis. It includes topics such as understanding competition, client requirements, key data points, and data collection frequency. The benefits of using these tools are also highlighted, including comprehensive market insights, real-time data collection, competitive advantage, customization and flexibility, actionable insights, scalability, and future growth.

## Brands

This section provides information about three brands: Wellcome, PARKnSHOP, and Ztore. It includes a brief description of each brand, their background, and the services they offer.
